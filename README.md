# WeatherMan

A JavaScript weather library with multiple weather povider options. Currently it
supports the following weather providers: Yahoo, OpenWeatherMap, YR.no, Dark Sky (formerly Forecast.io),
Weather Underground, Weather Unlocked, MAAS (Mars) and AQICN.org (for air quality
data). Use it in NodeJS, the browser, the command line or even with your Pebble app!

## Install

* For JavaScript usage: `npm install --save weather-man`
* For CLI usage: `npm install -g weather-man`

## Usage

### NodeJS

var WeatherMan = require('weather-man');

var wm = new WeatherMan(WeatherMan, 'apikey');
wm.getCurrent(latitude, longitude).then(function(result) {
    //If the result is for weather
    console.log(result.getTemperature(WeatherMan.CELCIUS));
    console.log(result.getWindChill(WeatherMan.FAHRENHEIT));
    console.log(result.getHeatIndex(WeatherMan.KELVIN));
    console.log(result.getWindSpeed(WeatherMan.MILES)); //Or WeatherMan.KILOMETERS or WeatherMan.METERS
    console.log(result.getHumidity());
    console.log(result.getCondition());
    console.log(result.getSunrise());
    console.log(result.getSunset());

    //If the result is for air quality
    console.log('AQI: ' + result.getAQI());
    console.log('Location: ' + result.getLocation());
